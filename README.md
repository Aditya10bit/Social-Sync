It is with great enthusiasm that my friend, Pratyush Prasad, and I present our collaborative endeavor: Social Sync, a dynamic social media application crafted entirely using Kotlin. As a passionate student developer, I embarked on this journey to explore the realms of mobile app development and create a platform that resonates with modern social networking trends.

Social Sync encapsulates a range of features synonymous with leading social media platforms, including:

Content Sharing: Users can  upload and share posts and reels, fostering creativity and expression within the community.

Personalized Feeds: The app curate personalized feeds, ensuring users stay engaged with content tailored to their interests.

User Profiles: Robust user profiles allow individuals to showcase their personality, interests, and achievements through posts, reels, and personal information.

Discoverability: An intuitive search feature enables users to discover new content, explore  and connect with like-minded individuals.

Engagement Tools: Social Sync offers features such as follow/unfollow options, likes, shares, and saves, facilitating meaningful interactions among users.

in brief the features include :

1. Splash Screen
2. Sign Up and Login
3. Home Page
4. Search Feature
5. Editable Profile
6. Like, & Share Feature
7. Uploading and Posting
8. Follow Feature

here's a comprehensive technology stack of our app:

1.API Integration:

Utilize Firebase for server-side functionalities, including authentication, database (Firestore), and storage.

2.Adapters:

Utilize RecyclerView adapters for efficiently managing and displaying lists of content such as posts, reels, and user profiles.

3.Material Design Components:

Leverage Material Components for Android to ensure consistent UI/UX design throughout the app, including Material Toolbar for navigation and action items.

4.Iconography:

Incorporate Flaticons for a visually appealing and cohesive set of icons across the app's interface.

5.Image Loading:

Utilize Glide library for efficient image loading, caching, and displaying within RecyclerViews and user profiles.

6.Time Formatting:

Integrate Marlon Lomeli's TimeAgo library for convenient and dynamic time formatting, enabling relative timestamps for content (e.g., "2 hours ago").

7.Custom UI Components:

Implement custom ScrollView for enhanced scrolling behavior and user experience, ensuring smooth navigation through feeds and profiles.
